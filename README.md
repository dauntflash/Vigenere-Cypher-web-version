# Vigenère Cipher Encryption/Decryption

This project implements the **Vigenère Cipher**, a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. The cipher uses a key to encrypt or decrypt messages, shifting each letter in the plaintext by the number of positions indicated by the corresponding letter in the key.

## Features

- **Customizable Alphabet**: Set a custom alphabet to use for encryption and decryption.
- **Key Validation**: Ensures that the key only contains characters from the selected alphabet.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Option to maintain or ignore case sensitivity during encoding and decoding.
- **Foreign Characters**: Option to include or ignore foreign characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) in the ciphering process.

## Technologies

- **React**: Built using React for dynamic user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## Usage

1. **Enter a Key**: Input the key you want to use for encryption or decryption.
2. **Choose Alphabet**: You can use the default English alphabet or set your own.
3. **Select Case Strategy**: Choose whether to maintain the case of the letters or to ignore case.
4. **Foreign Characters Option**: Decide whether to include foreign characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.) in the encryption process.
5. **Encryption/Decryption**: You can switch between encoding and decoding modes and enter your message to see the results.
